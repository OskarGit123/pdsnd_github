# A simple project to demonstrate how to use Git effectively.


## Purpose

This project is part of a Git training session. The main goal is **not** to build a complex application, but to **learn how to use Git correctly and efficiently**.

## Overview

The content and changes made in this project are intentionally kept simple. This is to ensure the focus remains on understanding Git concepts such as:

- Initializing a Git repository
- Creating and switching branches
- Staging and committing changes
- Merging branches

Each file is kept minimal, with basic content to allow hands-on practice with Git operations.

## Changed Files During Assignment

The following files were modified multiple times as part of the training exercises:

bikeshare.py — useless comments added

README.md — The README was especially taken seriously in the final commit, highlighting the importance of documentation.

> **Important:** The changes made in this project are deliberately simple. This is because the main purpose of this session is to practice **Git workflow**, not software development.

## License

This project is for educational purposes only.
